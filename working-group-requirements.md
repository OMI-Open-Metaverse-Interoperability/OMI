# Minimum requirements to form a working group

We operate in working groups, to divide work based on themes of interest and availability. If the Metaverse is for anyone, we believe that anyone can add value to the Metaverse. Our working groups have their own working agreements, with meeting times decided by those who attend the working groups. Backlogs, discussions, and agile ceremonies are decided on at the group level, as we have contributors from all around the World. The best way to get involved is to reach out to the working group directly. Our existing working groups are on various levels of maturity. Some have been working for months and have working agreements in place, and take detailed notes each week. Others meet more ad-hoc or are brand new, and may not have formalities documented yet. You are encouraged to get involved with any group that fits your knowledge, skills, abilities, and interests, and help shape the culture of that working group collectively.

## Required: 
- Submit a issue for review [proposing the working group](https://github.com/omigroup/omigroup/issues/new/choose). 
  - Group must be voted on to start next steps
  - Appoint a delegate or lead(s)
- Once approved an OMI admin will create a repo `omigroup/yournewgroup`
  - They can use this template [omigroup/working-group-template](https://github.com/omigroup/working-group-template)
- Create basic readme with: What this group is, when you meet, how to get involved. 
- Create backlog in your repo for tracking potential work, active work, and reminders. This helps people get involved and work async in between meetings, and to ensure we call out blockers and don't lose sight of previous commitments (Assistance available to set this up) 
- Publish a link to the groups repo and their meeting times on the main [omigroup/omigroup](https://github.com/omigroup/omigroup) readme 
- If 2 consecutive meetings go unattended then the group enters inactive status. This allows others to know they can get involved and pick up where the group left off while ensuring we don't repeat past efforts. 

### Recommended: 
- [Working agreement](https://github.com/omigroup/omigroup/issues/68) (assistance available)
- Create an agenda before your next meeting 
- Take notes during your meeting 
- Record meetngs if possible 
- Have a retro! It helps with iteration 
- Create a role on discord so that you can ping all members or interested parties of that group for reminders of meetings!
