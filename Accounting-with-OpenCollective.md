Sometimes we get an email like this on admin@omigroup, that requires that we upload receipts for expenses from our Open Collective account.

## Login to Open Collective 
- we use OC to track expenses, and manage our funding/donations transparently. 
- this requires that you create an account 
- when you create an account you will get a secret code. 
- we pay per-seat though, so please refrain from adding a bunch new seats to our 1password account. 

### Submitting in Open Collective
- The only way I could find to make this work is to click the link directly in our email that says "submit receipt". 
- This brings you to a page like this for each missing expense. Just add your receipt, add a brief description and submit:

## Finding the missing receipts 
- you can login and find the billing page and print. 
- or you can print the email receipt for 1password/gsuite/miro, etc.

- 1password sends us an invoice via email every month, but when you click on the "billing" link it doesn't actually take you to any invoices. So I am going to print and submit a printed out email copy of the invoice.

### Open Collective has a new recurring expenses feature 

Today while writing this quick note, I noticed that you can create recurring templates.
