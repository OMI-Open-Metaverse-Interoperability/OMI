The Open Metaverse Interoperability Group is focused on bridging virtual worlds by designing and promoting protocols for identity, social graphs, inventory, and more. Our members include businesses and individuals working towards this common goal. Aside from technical work, OMI aims to create a community of artists, creators, developers, and other innovators to discuss and explore concepts surrounding the design and development of virtual worlds.

## OMI Core Values

- We collaborate, driven by research, privacy and accessibility, to make the metaverse more human.
- We work incrementally, iteratively, and with intent. 
- We are creating a cooperative, sustainable culture of innovation. 
- We empower the people making the metaverse.
- We must cultivate resiliency by championing diversity, and freedom of choice.

## FAQ

### Are you really trying to build the Metaverse?

No. Any one group, be it a company or organization cannot build the metaverse. With OMI we hope to form consensus around ways we can turn siloed virtual worlds into a network of interoperable worlds. People have very different ideas of what their worlds should look like and how they should operate. It's not our job to tell them how to create their worlds. We aim to bring world builders together and create protocols so that traversing the metaverse is as seamless as possible.
