The Open Metaverse Interoperability Group is focused on bridging virtual worlds by designing and promoting protocols for identity, social graphs, inventory, and more. Our members include businesses and individuals working towards this common goal. Aside from technical work, OMI aims to create a community of artists, creators, developers, and other innovators to discuss and explore concepts surrounding the design and development of virtual worlds.

## OMI Objectives

- We collaborate to make the metaverse more human.
- We empower the people making the metaverse.
- We are creating a cooperative, sustainable culture of innovation.
- We incrementally deliver value with intent.
- We must achieve resiliency through diversity, and freedom of choice.

## W3C Metaverse Interoperability Community Group

We recently formed a [W3C Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/about/) to help structure our standards work and provide ourselves a proper IP protection framework. We are in the process of electing chairs. If you'd like to nominate yourself or others, please do so in [this thread](https://github.com/omigroup/OMI/discussions/17).

To become a member of the W3C Metaverse Interoperability Community Group, you can [join here](https://www.w3.org/community/metaverse-interop/).

## Areas of Exploration

While we don't have an official scope of work for OMI set yet, here are a few areas we are looking into.

### Identity

### Friends List / Social Graph

### Inventory / Trading Virtual Items

### Avatars

### 3D Content

### Portable Scripted Objects / Scenes

## FAQ

### Are you really trying to build the Metaverse?

No. Any one group, be it a company or organization cannot build the metaverse. With OMI we hope to form consensus around ways we can turn siloed virtual worlds into a network of interoperable worlds. People have very different ideas of what their worlds should look like and how they should operate. It's not our job to tell them how to create their worlds. We aim to bring world builders together and create protocols so that traversing the metaverse is as seamless as possible.
