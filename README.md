🗓️[OMI Calendar](#calendar)

The Open Metaverse Interoperability Group is focused on bridging virtual worlds by designing and promoting protocols for identity, social graphs, inventory, and more. Our members include businesses and individuals working towards this common goal. Aside from technical work, OMI aims to create a community of artists, creators, developers, and other innovators to discuss and explore concepts surrounding the design and development of virtual worlds.

## OMI Core Values

- We collaborate, driven by research, privacy and accessibility, to make the metaverse more human.
- We work incrementally, iteratively, and with intent. 
- We are creating a cooperative, sustainable culture of innovation. 
- We empower the people making the metaverse.
- We must cultivate resiliency by championing diversity, and freedom of choice.

## W3C Metaverse Interoperability Community Group

We recently formed a [W3C Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/about/) to help structure our standards work and provide ourselves a proper IP protection framework.

To become a member of the W3C Metaverse Interoperability Community Group, you can [join here](https://www.w3.org/community/metaverse-interop/).

## Working groups 

We operate in working groups, to divide work based on themes of interest and availability. If the Metaverse is for anyone, we believe that anyone can add value to the Metaverse. Our working groups have their own working agreements, with meeting times decided by those who attend the working groups. Backlogs, discussions, and agile ceremonies are decided on at the group level, as we have contributors from all around the World. The best way to get involved is to reach out to the working group directly. Our existing working groups are on various levels of maturity. Some have been working for months and have working agreements in place, and take detailed notes each week. Others meet more ad-hoc or are brand new, and may not have formalities documented yet. You are encouraged to get involved with any group that fits your knowledge, skills, abilities, and interests, and help shape the culture of that working group collectively.

## FAQ

### Are you really trying to build the Metaverse?

No. Any one group, be it a company or organization cannot build the metaverse. With OMI we hope to form consensus around ways we can turn siloed virtual worlds into a network of interoperable worlds. People have very different ideas of what their worlds should look like and how they should operate. It's not our job to tell them how to create their worlds. We aim to bring world builders together and create protocols so that traversing the metaverse is as seamless as possible.
